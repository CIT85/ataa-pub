# Beşiktaş: Beyond the Pitch

## Why I Chose This Topic

Beşiktaş isn’t just a football club — it’s a way of life. From the legendary İnönü Stadium to the rebellious spirit of Çarşı, the club represents more than just the game. As a Beşiktaş fan, I’ve always been drawn to the stories that unfold off the pitch as much as the ones on it. This project explores the history, rivalries, and behind-the-scenes drama that make Beşiktaş unique in the world of football.

## AI Prompts & Content Samples

### Prompts Used:
- "Write a paragraph about the origins of Beşiktaş football club"
- "Describe the rivalry between Beşiktaş, Galatasaray and Fenerbahçe"
- "Create a table showing Beşiktaş’s Süper Lig titles by year"
- "A conceptual digital illustration showing a referee in black showing a red card, while Beşiktaş fans in the background (black-and-white colors, scarves, and banners with logos) react angrily. The setting should feel like a tense night match. Beşiktaş logos should appear on fan gear, flags, or banners. No other team logos. Resolution max 500px wide."
- "A dramatic digital illustration of a Turkish football derby between Beşiktaş and Fenerbahçe. One side of the stadium is packed with Beşiktaş fans holding black-and-white banners and flares; the other side with yellow-and-blue Fenerbahçe fans. Include accurate logos on scarves and flags for both clubs. Show smoke, lighting, and intense atmosphere. Resolution max 500px wide."
-"A grayscale digital illustration of Beşiktaş’s ultra group Çarşı in the stands. Fans are holding up protest-style banners, waving flags with anarchist symbols, and wearing Beşiktaş scarves. Include realistic Beşiktaş logos and slogans like “Çarşı Her Şeye Karşı.” The mood should feel rebellious and energetic. No political figures. Resolution no wider than 500px."
- "A digital illustration of Vodafone Park stadium in Istanbul during a night match. The stadium is full of Beşiktaş fans waving black-and-white flags and wearing scarves. Include realistic Beşiktaş logos on the flags and banners. The Bosphorus should be visible behind the stadium. Stadium lights should create a dramatic night atmosphere. Resolution no wider than 500px."

### Sample Output:
> "Beşiktaş’s fan base, led by the iconic group Çarşı, is known for being politically outspoken and fiercely loyal. Whether it’s a regular match or a heated derby, the energy around Beşiktaş games is unmatched."

# Project Phase 2 – Beşiktaş: Beyond the Pitch

## Typography Enhancements

- Used `font-family: Arial, sans-serif` for a clean and readable appearance across the site.
- Headings (`h1–h4`) were styled with varying `font-size`, `font-weight`, and `text-transform` to establish a clear visual hierarchy.
- Paragraphs have consistent `line-height` and spacing to improve readability.
- Links (`<a>`) include `:hover`, `:focus`, and `:visited` states to enhance usability and accessibility.

## Decorative or Positional Enhancements

- The navigation bar uses `position: sticky` to stay fixed at the top of the page for better UX.
- A "Back to Top" link inside the `<footer>` is styled with `position: fixed` so it remains visible while scrolling.
- A `.callout` element is centered with `position: relative` and used to highlight information on the site.
- All `<img>` and `<figure>` elements are centered using `margin: auto` for clean visual alignment.
- Visually hidden `<h2>` in the `<nav>` ensures better accessibility without affecting the layout.
- Layouts created with `inline-block`, `float`, and `positioning`

## Phase 3 Overview

In this phase, I implemented Flexbox for the header layout and used CSS Grid to organize the main content sections across the site. This allows for a cleaner, more responsive structure. The header layout now adjusts spacing automatically, and the content sections align neatly in two columns.

## New Subpage

The new subpage `fans.html` highlights the global reach of Beşiktaş supporters. It’s linked from the homepage and follows the same semantic HTML5 structure. The page includes a responsive image and descriptive metadata to match the rest of the site.

## Image Optimization

All images use `width` and `height` attributes to prevent layout shift, and `loading="lazy"` is used for faster performance. Images are styled responsively with `max-width: 100%` and `height: auto`. New images were resized and renamed clearly before being added to the `/img/` folder.

## Last-Minute Notes
- All validation passed
- Layout and responsiveness confirmed on multiple screen sizes
